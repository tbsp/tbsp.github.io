<h1>Analog audio.</h1>
<p>For most of my life I've longed to attain a level of mastery over one (or several) musical instruments. Sadly this has yet to occur, but that hasn't stopped me from collecting a variety of them in hopes of one day having one click. These are listed roughly in order of when they were obtained.</p>
<h3>Zelda themed ocarina</h3>
<p>Purchased from a market in Salzburg, Austria. The sound of Zelda music being played on an ocarina in front of an old church on a cobblestone market square was magical.</p>
<h3>4-hole ocarina</h3>
<h3>Yamaha YP-50 Digital Piano</h3>
<p>I took piano lessons for a few months as a child and found it uninteresting. As I suspect is common I now wish I'd stuck with it. I've tried a few times to self-teach myself piano as an adult, lasting as long as several months at a time, but never retaining any real ability.</p>
<h3>Mahalo Ukulele</h3>
<p>I know perhaps 15 chords and a few strumming patterns. Just enough to seem like I know what I'm doing to someone that doesn't know what I'm doing.</p>
<h3>Strumstick</h3>
<p>I love the banjo-like sound of this instrument. It's very fun to strum or pluck away and explore simple tunes with this very light intrument.</p>
<h3>CODE EDC</h3>
<p>When searching for interesting ocarinas I came across the Mountain Ocarina, which seemed very promising. Sadly it was no longer being produced and the creator was in the middle of a long journey designing a new instrument. Years later the CODA EDC (every day carry) was revealed! A quirky item but <i>very</i> easy to play.</p>
<h3>Nuvo Recorder+</h3>
<p>After not getting too far with the CODA EDC I thought perhaps going for a more traditional instrument might be worth trying. Nuvo has a line of instruments targetting children, meant to simplify fingering. What surprised me immediately was how much more sensitive the recorder+ is to airflow than the CODA EDC, making the CODA suddenly more appealing due to the simplicity of producing clean notes, as well as accessing the second octave.</p>
