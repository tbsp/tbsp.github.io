<h1>A simple action game for Game Boy</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Shock Lobster is an action game developed for the Game Boy as an entry to the Game Boy Competition 2021.</p>
<p>Gameplay centers around using a variety of skills to deal maximum damage while avoiding oncoming obstables, trying to reach the highest possible score before defeat.</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>My motivation for the game was semi-complicated skill priority systems in MMORPG games. While using the skills isn't challenging (hold the dpad and press a button), using them effectively to maximize output takes some practice.</p>
<p>Initially the game had 8 damage/buff skills, but that left no way to lose. My solution was to sacrifice a single skill and replace it with a single-button movement ability (jump/jet), along with randomzied obstacles so the player couldn't focus entirely on dealing damage.</p>
<p>The pearl collection mechanic was added to provide a collectible currency which could be spent in-game. This was inspired somewhat by games like Jetpack Joyride, and for a while I was planning to add a quest/level mechanic, but it never quite felt right and in the end I ran out of time to implement it. The pearls were re-purposed as a skill unlock/upgrade tool, which I feel gives the game a decent ramp up without throwing too much complexity at the player out of the gates.</p>
