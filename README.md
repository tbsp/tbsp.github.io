This is the repository for my personal website, project archive, journal and wiki [WastingMoves](http://wastingmoves.com).  

WastingMoves is a static website generated with a fork of [nchrs](https://nchrs.xyz/), which was forked from [oscean](https://github.com/XXIIVV/Oscean).
The original code is by Clemens Scott and Devine Lu Linvega. I've tweaked the link formatting, switched to a dark theme, and added a custom markdown entry to increase Persian font sizes for readability.
