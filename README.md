# Anchors

This is the repository for my personal website, project archive, journal and wiki [nchrs](http://nchrs.xyz).  
Nchrs is a static website generated with a fork of [oscean](https://github.com/XXIIVV/Oscean).
The original code is by Devine Lu Linvega and modified to support a custom set of markdown, linked images, and a few other adaptions.
